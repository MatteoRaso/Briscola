There are certain attributes that affect which card a bot chooses. We can represent these 
attributes as genes and use the gene to determine how much it affects the bot's choice.

Attributes:
Risk-taking behaviour
Willingness to preserve a card for later use
How much its current score affects it
How much the cards that have already been played affect it
