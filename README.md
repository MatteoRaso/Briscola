This repository previously held various subdirectories that contained
AI approaches towards the Italian card game Briscola. It was supposed
to be a small project, but as time went on, the scope increased. I've
decided to remove all the code and place them into their own repositories
instead of having one mega repo. This repository is being kept to
perserve the git log in case I need to make a revert and to be used
as a playground to compare the AI after they're finished.
